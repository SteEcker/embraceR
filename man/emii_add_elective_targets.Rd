\usage{
emii_add_elective_targets(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{EMII dataframe}
}
\value{
A data frame with additional columns indicating the elective target analysis results, including whether the case is high risk, has inguinal involvement, and the selected elective target algorithm outcome.
}
\description{
This function processes the input data frame to analyze and determine elective targets based on various criteria including nodal information, tumor dimensions, and risk assessments. It integrates multiple internal functions to perform the analysis and finally adds the elective target analysis results to the input data frame.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `df` is your data frame with the necessary columns:
# result <- elective_targets(df)
}
